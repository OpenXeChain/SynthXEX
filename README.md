## Description

SynthXEX is the XEX(2) builder (and thus the last step in building an executable) for the [OpenXeChain](https://github.com/OpenXeChain) project. OpenXeChain is a free/libre/open-source development toolchain for the Xbox 360, designed to do the same job as the official Xbox 360 SDK (building applications which run on the Xbox 360 OS), without the legal and outdated tech issues which come with that.

This was developed by referencing public knowledge on the XEX(2) file format, along with staring at XEX files in a hex editor to decypher aspects which do not seem to be documented anywhere. No Microsoft code was decompiled to develop SynthXEX, and I ask that any contributors do not do so either.

This is in early development and MANY features are missing (most notable exports). No guarantees are made as to the functionality of the program, or it's stability. Functionality may change at any time.

This *should* support any POSIX-compliant operating system, along with Windows.


## Building (POSIX, standard method)

### Prerequisites

- A C compiler (GCC/Clang)
- CMake (>= 3.24.2)
- Make
- Git

To install these on Debian: ```sudo apt install gcc cmake make git```

### Downloading

Clone: ```git clone https://github.com/OpenXeChain/SynthXEX```

### Compiling

Switch to the newly cloned directory: ```cd SynthXEX```

Make a build directory and switch to it: ```mkdir build && cd build```

Generate build scripts (replacing ```<prefix>``` with where you want to install, e.g. /usr for /usr/bin/synthxex): ```cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<prefix> ..```

Build: ```make```

Install: ```sudo make install```


## Building (Guix)

### Prerequisites

- Guix
- Git

### Compiling

Choose ONE of the options below.

#### Compiling & Installing

Clone: ```git clone https://github.com/OpenXeChain/SynthXEX```

Switch to the newly cloned directory: ```cd SynthXEX```

Install: ```guix time-machine -C channels.scm -- package -f synthxex.scm```

#### Compiling Only

Clone: ```git clone https://github.com/OpenXeChain/SynthXEX```

Switch to the newly cloned directory: ```cd SynthXEX```

Build: ```guix time-machine -C channels.scm -- build -f synthxex.scm```

#### Compiling & Installing to Config

TODO


## Building (Nix)

### Prerequisites

- Nix
- Git

### Compiling

Choose ONE of the options below.

#### Compiling & Installing

Clone: ```git clone https://github.com/OpenXeChain/SynthXEX```

Switch to the newly cloned directory: ```cd SynthXEX```

Run: ```nix profile install .#synthxex```

#### Compiling Only

Clone: ```git clone https://github.com/OpenXeChain/SynthXEX```

Switch to the newly cloned directory: ```cd SynthXEX```

Run: ```nix build .#synthxex```

#### Compiling & Installing to Config

Add SynthXEX to your configuration.nix file:

```
{ config, modulesPath, lib, pkgs, ... }:

let
  synthxex = builtins.getFlake "git+https://github.com/OpenXeChain/SynthXEX";
  synthxexPkgs = synthxex.packages.${pkgs.hostPlatform.system};
in {
  # ...
  environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [
    # ...
    synthxexPkgs.synthxex
  ];
}
```


## Special thanks to:
- [InvoxiPlayGames](https://github.com/InvoxiPlayGames), for help understanding the XEX format
- [emoose](https://github.com/emoose), for xex1tool, which was very useful for taking apart XEX files and getting info from them
- [Free60Project](https://github.com/Free60Project), for documentation on the XEX format, which was useful in the early days
- [Vali0004](https://github.com/Vali0004), for helping clean up and harden code, along with Nix packaging
- Several members of the Xbox360Hub Discord server, for a multitude of reasons
